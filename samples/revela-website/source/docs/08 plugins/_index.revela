## Configuration

Plugins store their settings in `project.json`:

```json
{
  "Spectara.Revela.Plugin.Statistics": {
    "MaxEntriesPerCategory": 15,
    "SortByCount": true
  },
  "Spectara.Revela.Plugin.Serve": {
    "Port": 8080
  }
}
```

Settings can also be overridden with environment variables:

```bash
SPECTARA__REVELA__PLUGIN__SERVE__PORT=3000
```

## Community Plugins

Revela supports third-party plugins from any NuGet source. Community plugins use their own package prefix:

```bash
# Install from custom NuGet feed
revela plugin install MyPlugin --source https://my-feed.example.com/v3/index.json
```

> **Note:** Community plugins are not verified by Spectara. Install at your own risk.
