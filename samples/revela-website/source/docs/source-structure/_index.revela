Revela supports two approaches for organizing your photos, and you can combine them in the same project:

<div class="features-grid">

### 📁 Traditional Galleries

Photos belong to one gallery. Images stored directly in the gallery folder.

### 🔍 Filter Galleries

Photos appear in multiple galleries. All images in a shared `_images/` folder.

### 🔀 Hybrid Approach

Mix both approaches. Some galleries with local images, others with filters.

</div>

## Traditional Galleries

Each gallery contains its own images directly in the folder.

```
source/
├── _index.revela          # Homepage
├── events/
│   ├── _index.revela      # Gallery page
│   ├── event-001.jpg
│   └── event-002.jpg
├── portraits/
│   ├── _index.revela
│   └── portrait-001.jpg
└── landscapes/
    ├── _index.revela
    └── mountain.jpg
```

### Characteristics

- ✅ Simple and intuitive
- ✅ Each photo belongs to exactly one gallery
- ✅ Easy to manage manually
- ❌ Photos cannot appear in multiple galleries

## Filter Galleries

All images are stored in a shared `_images/` folder. Galleries use filter expressions to select which images to display.

```
source/
├── _index.revela          # Homepage
├── _images/               # Shared image pool
│   ├── canon-event-001.jpg
│   ├── sony-landscape-002.jpg
│   └── sony-portrait-003.jpg
├── canon/
│   └── _index.revela      # filter = "exif.make == 'Canon'"
├── sony/
│   └── _index.revela      # filter = "exif.make == 'Sony'"
└── portraits/
    └── _index.revela      # filter = "contains(filename, 'portrait')"
```

### The `_images/` Folder

The underscore prefix is significant:

- `_images/` is **not** rendered as a gallery itself
- Images are only accessible via filter expressions
- You can use any name: `_photos/`, `_pool/`, `_shared/`

### Example Front Matter

```toml
+++
title = "Canon Photos"
description = "All photos taken with Canon cameras"
filter = "exif.make == 'Canon'"
+++
```

## Hybrid Approach

Combine both approaches in the same project:

```
source/
├── _images/                   # Shared pool for filter galleries
│   ├── 2024-trip-001.jpg
│   └── 2025-event-001.jpg
│
├── by-year/                   # Filter galleries
│   ├── 2024/
│   │   └── _index.revela      # filter = "year(dateTaken) == 2024"
│   └── 2025/
│       └── _index.revela      # filter = "year(dateTaken) == 2025"
│
└── clients/                   # Traditional galleries (exclusive)
    └── wedding-smith/
        ├── _index.revela
        └── ceremony-001.jpg   # Only in this gallery
```

## Choosing the Right Approach

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Simple portfolio | Traditional |
| Photos need multiple categorizations | Filter |
| Client work (exclusive galleries) | Traditional |
| "By camera", "By year" views | Filter |
| Mix of exclusive and shared content | Hybrid |

## Common Patterns

### Homepage with Recent Photos

```toml
+++
title = "Welcome"
filter = "all | sort dateTaken desc | limit 6"
+++
```

### Category Landing Page (No Images)

```toml
+++
title = "Browse by Camera"
template = "page"
+++

Select a camera brand below.
```
